1981,58475,British humor is the best,20,10
383,4643,Compromise is overwhelmingly the most likely outcome – just a question of how much death &amp; destruction happens before then,20,10
71,1395,That should be the nature of the debate,20,10
265,3209,"Most probable outcome by far is a horrible war of attrition that destroys Ukraine &amp; severely damages Russia, with massive body count on both sides.And, in the end, the same outcome. So why?",20,10

3214,57357,SpaceX has already withdrawn its request for funding,17,10
895,8736,"Wrong analogy. America also had a humiliating withdrawal from Afghanistan. No one in America sees that country as part of America.Crimea *is* seen as a crucial part of Russia by Russia, much as Hawaii is seen as a crucial part of America.",17,10

2727,45837,Practice makes perfect …,17,10
243,3448,"Russia has been punched in the nose and forced to retreat many times by Ukraine. But what you don’t want to do is give Russia a choice of total, humiliating defeat or nukes – then the probability of them using nukes is high.",17,10
380,4944,"Obviously many disagree with this logic, but what do they think is their probability of being wrong about WW3. If they say 0%, they are utterly dangerous fools.",17,10

2523,15883,"Whether one likes it or not, Crimea is absolutely seen as a core part of Russia by Russia. Crimea is also of critical national security importance to Russia, as it is their southern navy base.From their standpoint losing Crimea is like USA losing Hawaii &amp; Pearl Harbor.",17,10
156,3728,Exactly,17,10
3111,19765,"If Russia is faced with the choice of losing Crimea or using battlefield nukes, they will choose the latter.We’ve already sanctioned/cutoff Russia in every possible way, so what more do they have left to lose? If we nuke Russia back, they will nuke us and then we have WW3.",17,10

246,3226,"It has required a lot of our resources. Going into super lockdown mode slows down new development progress, as we have to resist attacks from a sophisticated adversary actively at war.",15,10
224,3323,"DoD provided about 3% of the Falcon 1 development cost. Appreciated, certainly, but should be seen in context.",15,10
227,3243,Of course. And their signal jamming systems are also getting better.,15,10
1540,20168,"The amount SpaceX is requesting for a major battlefield advantage is less than the cost of one new GPS satellite. Ironically, GPS doesn’t work on battlefields, as the signal is easy to jam, but Starlink does.",15,10
817,5474,"Would be great if someday humanity stopped pointing nukes at itself that would destroy almost all life on Earth.In any given year, there is a chance above zero that they will be launched. We are now at the highest risk in 60 years.",15,10

473,5464,"Also, Starlink is still losing money! It is insanely difficult for a LEO communications constellation to avoid bankruptcy – that was the fate of every company that tried this before.When asked what the goal of Starlink was at a space conference, I said “not go bankrupt”.",14,10
